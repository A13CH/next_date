This program is designed to calculate the next date for a given date, taking into account leap years and different month lenghts.

This program uses a python module called pytest to store and execute its unit tests. 
With the pytest extension downloaded on VsCode, you can simply click the flask icon to view and execute all unit tests.
The configuration for test auto detection can be found in the .vscode/settings.json file.
